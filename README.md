# Java-RussianPeasantMultiplication
# A homework assignment from Design and Analysis of Algorithms course that analyzes the Russian Peasant Multiplication algorithm.
# This algorithm is another way to multiply numbers, which goes as follows:
# Given n * m, do (n/2) * (m*2). Repeat until n = 1. If n is odd, add m.
# Ex: 50 * 78
# 25 * 156 --- 156
# 12 * 312
# 6 * 624
# 3 * 1248 --- 1248
# 1 * 2496 --- 2496
# 156 + 1248 + 2496 = 3900 == 50 * 78
